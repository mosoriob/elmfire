# ELMFIRE - Eulerian Level set Model of FIRE Spread

ELMFIRE is an operational wildland fire spread model. Some of its common 
applications include:

* Forecasting spread of fires in real time
* Reconstructing spread of historical fires
* Quantifying landscape-scale potential fire behavior potential
* Estimating annual burn probability and fire severity

As part of the [Pyrecast project](https://pyrecast.org), ELMFIRE is used 
to forecast the spread of most large fires in the Continental US.

The mathematical formulation of ELMFIRE is presented in [its original 
journal article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2013.08.014). For 
additional information, including instructions for how to get started 
using ELMFIRE, please visit [https://elmfire.io](https://elmfire.io/).
